# Movie-Recommendation-System-
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Aim is to prepare a model using the concepts of data science, that is capable of sorting and suggesting the films based on their ratings. </p>
<h2>Application Used</h2>
<p>Here, I have used <strong>Thonny</strong> application to write my code. Thonny is a free and open-source integrated development environment for Python and downloading it is as a easy as it is to pronounce its name.<br><a href="https://thonny.org/"><Strong>Click here to install the application</Strong></a><br> There are many other applications to run the code such as Visual Studio Code, Pycharm, Replit, Jupyter Notebooks,etc.  </p>
<h2>Language Used</h2>
<p>There are two main langauges in the world of Data Science, <strong>Python</strong> and <strong>R</strong>. Python is a general and multifield coding language where as R is   a scientific langauge. I have used Python langauge to write my code.</p>
<h2>Dataset</h2>
<p>Dataset can be taken from the Kaggle website.Kaggle is a data science competition platform and online community of data scientists and machine learning practitioners under Google LLC. Here  I am here adding the link for the dataset that I have used. I have used a tsv file in this project which I have taken from geeksforgeeks website. <a href="https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/Movie_Id_Titles.csv"><strong>Click here to download the dataset.</strong></a></p><br>
<h2>Libraries Used </h2>
<ol><li><strong>Pandas</strong>- Imported as <strong>pd</strong>. This library is important for reading the <strong>CSV(Comma Seperated Values</strong>file.</li>
<li><strong>Maytplotlib</strong>is a python library used to create 2D graphs and plots by using python scripts.</li></ol>.
<h2> Concept Used</h2>
<p>The concept used is very simple. Here I am first sorting the mocies in the descending order and then suggesting the top 5 movies. </p>
